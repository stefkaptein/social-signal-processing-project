This directory contains directories, one per coder, each of which
contain files produced using the ICSITopicSegmenter NXT tool. 

This file documents 
- how to view the coded meetings, 
- how to contribute to this coding, and
- brief statistics of the coding.


Using this data in NXT
----------------------

Note that as of NXT 1.3, you should no longer need to edit the
metadata file: lazy loading is implemented so all codings can exist in
the metadata file without being loaded (until they are requested).

To view topic segmentations of a specific meeting, e.g., Bic001, 
copy a group of XML files (Bic001.*.segs.xml and Bic001.topic.xml) 
from some directory here into your local main ICSI meeting data directory
(Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Main). Then add the following to
the 'interaction-codings' section of your metadata file (normally
called ICSI-metadata.xml, under Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Main):

            <!-- topic codings from the NXT topic Segmenter -->
            <coding-file name="topic">
                <structural-layer name="topic-layer" recursive-points-to="segment-layer">
                    <code name="topic">
                        <attribute name="type" value-type="string"/>
                        <attribute name="description" value-type="string"/>
                    </code>
                </structural-layer>
            </coding-file>

You will find that applications now load any data and the tool
ICSITopicSegmentation will be usable to annotate the corpus.

For coding instructions using the NXT tool, 
please refer to instructions.pdf under the same directory.
There is also a help menu on the tool itself.


Committing Your Data
--------------------

Once you are happy with a topic segmentation you've produced
(if it's called Bic001), please commit your data to CVS 
in the following format: make yourself a directory under:
 Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/TopicSegmentation
called e.g. 'coder1' using this command (if you are at the root of
your CVS repository):
 cvs add Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/TopicSegmentation/coder1

Now copy the file(s) you have produced using a command such as this:
 cp Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Main/Bic001.topic.xml 
	Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/TopicSegmentation/coder1
 cp Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Main/Bic001.*.segs.xml 
	Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/TopicSegmentation/coder1

commit your new file via:
 
 cvs add Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/TopicSegmentation/coder1/Bic001.topic.xml
 cvs commit Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/TopicSegmentation/coder1/Bic001.topic.xml

 cvs add Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/TopicSegmentation/coder1/Bic001.*.segs.xml
 cvs commit Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/TopicSegmentation/coder1/Bic001.*.segs.xml

Note that to create a directory in CVS you do not need the 'commit'
command, but to add a file you need both 'add' and 'commit'.

If there is any background information about your data you think it's
important for people who use the repository to know, add a README file
to your directory.


To view Galley Segmentation
---------------------------------------------

Michel Galley et al have produced a top-level spanning topic
segmentation for one third of the corpus that brings together codings
from at least three coders per observation. 
If you would like to view their codings, please find them at the directory:
 Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/TopicSegmentation/Galley.
Simply copy the data into your own NXT data directory (Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Main).
You will be able to view them with our tool.


The coded meetings
---------------------------------------------

All the meetins are now coded.

Coder	codings	under
1	47	sashby
2	23	s0199920

G	25	Galley

Below is a list of meetings with available coding(s).
The extra column, G, indicates whether the meeting has
also been coded for topic segments by Michel Galley, a
separate contribution with a different format.  We suspect
the Galley coding is highly related to the top level of
our topic segmentation.  His coding is distributed as simple
timestamps for the start and end time of segments.

GOLD STANDARD
-------------

For abstractive summaries Jonathan Kilgour promoted the following set
of annotators' codings to be treated as the 'gold standard' (though in
fact there were only 12 cases of overlap between the annotators).
