Other: Mostly on one topic, in section 'where is X?' example they are often talking at cross-purposes, hard to know how to segment this.

Other: Quite a lot of smaller topics covered. A lot of joking around in this meeting, I wasn't always sure how much of it to mark as 'chitchat'.

Date: 19/6/2004

Degree of Difficulty: 2

Other: Discussion moves quite fast in the main part of the meeting. A little unsure of some of the topic labels as in many cases there are several equally plausible ones.

Degree of Difficulty: 3

Other: Fairly confident of super-topic structure but within subtopics they were pretty circular, often returning briefly to the same points within a later topic. Also, a couple of issues re recording setup within opening I wasn't sure whether to mark

Time: 2.5
Degree of Difficulty: 3
Degree of Confidence: 3
Other: Straight-forward super-topic structure, three students reporting their progress. But I was less confident of the actual subject matter, therefore not so sure of sub-topic structure and some of the topic labels are quite long.

Degree of Difficulty: 2
Degree of Confidence: 4
Other: Fairly easy to follow. Some of their topics seemed quite esoteric, wasn't sure if they shouldn't be 'chitchat', but marked them anyway. Weird bit at the end between 2842-2979 where there's a transcribed portion that isn't on the audio but from the transcript looks like it belongs in the middle of the meeting somewhere. Doesn't say anything much though so I put it in 'closing'.

Degree of Difficulty: 2
Degree of Confidence: 4
Other: Reasonably straight-forward discussion though long. A lot of the topics kind of rolled on from each other and I wasn't always certain of where to put the boundary. Also, there were a few topics under 'transcribers' experiences' that would have more properly belonged in 'transcription issues', but I didn't bother to separate them.
