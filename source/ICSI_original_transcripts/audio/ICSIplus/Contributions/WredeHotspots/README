Preliminary Version of ICSI Meeting Hotspot Annotation
------------------------------------------------------

Added to the corpus by: Jonathan Kilgour
Date: 01/05/2004
Authored by: Britta Wrede, University of Bielefeld
Quality: We should stress that this represents a preliminary version
 of Britta Wrede's hotspot data and at the time of writing a more
 systematic and complete version is being undertaken.
Ref: B. Wrede and E. Shriberg, The Relationship Between Dialogue Acts
   and Hot Spots in Meetings. Proc. IEEE Speech Recognition and
   Understanding Workshop, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Dec. 2003.

I (Jonathan Kilgour) attempted to produce as thorough a translation of
Britta's preliminary hotspot annotations as possible. The main
division is between the hotspot coding which is one-file-per-meeting
and an involvement coding which is coded for each 'agent' (meeting
participant). 

There are hotspots and involvement files for these 20 observations:
 
Bed003  Bmr006  Bmr018	Bed006  Bmr007  Bmr024
Bed008  Bmr008  Bmr026	Bed010  Bmr009  Bro011
Bmr001  Bmr012  Bro012	Bmr002  Bmr013  Bro017
Bmr005  Bmr014


Using this data in NXT
----------------------

To use hotspot data alone, copy '*.hotspots.xml' into your main ICSI
meeting data directory and add this to the 'interaction-codings'
section of your metadata file (normally called ICSI-metadata.xml):

            <!-- hotspots courtesy of Britta Wrede, Bielefeld -->
            <coding-file name="hotspots">
                <time-aligned-layer name="hotspot-layer">
                    <code name="hotspot">
                        <attribute name="participants" value-type="string"/>
                        <attribute name="score" value-type="number"/>
                    </code>
                    <code name="pothot">
                        <attribute name="participants" value-type="string"/>
                        <attribute name="score" value-type="number"/>
                    </code>
                    <code name="overlap">
                        <attribute name="participants" value-type="string"/>
                        <attribute name="score" value-type="number"/>
                    </code>
                    <code name="joke">
                        <attribute name="participants" value-type="string"/>
                        <attribute name="score" value-type="number"/>
                    </code>
                    <code name="nonhot">
                        <attribute name="participants" value-type="string"/>
                        <attribute name="score" value-type="number"/>
                    </code>
                </time-aligned-layer>
            </coding-file>

You will find that applications now load this data and the hotspots
can be loaded.

To use individual involvement data, copy '*.involvement.xml' into your
main ICSI meeting data directory and add this to the 'agent-codings'
section of your metadata file:

            <!-- Involvement codes courtesy of Britta Wrede, Bielefeld -->
            <coding-file name="involvement">
                <time-aligned-layer name="involvement-layer">
                    <code name="involvement">
                        <attribute name="type" value-type="enumerated">
                            <value>involv</value>
                            <value>amused</value>
                            <value>disagr</value>
                        </attribute>
                        <attribute name="participant" value-type="string"/>
                        <attribute name="score" value-type="number"/>
                    </code>
                </time-aligned-layer>
            </coding-file>

Now you should be able to query the involvement of each meeting
contributor. Remember that in the NXT data, meeting contributors are
called 'agents'. These agents are referred to anonymously via names
like 'A', 'B' etc. To see the ICSI version of their ID, query the
'participant' attribute of the involvement tag (or many others through
the corpus).
