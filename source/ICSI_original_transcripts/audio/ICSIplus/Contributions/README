Contributions
-------------
This area is for contributions to the corpus that do not form part of
our core distribution. We do not make any claims as to the quality of
this data though that should be noted where possible in the README
file in each subdirectory. The README files will contain at least some
information about the provenance of the data. We also require that the
README in each subdirectory contains a metadata fragment and
instructions on how the data can be loaded and used within NXT.
