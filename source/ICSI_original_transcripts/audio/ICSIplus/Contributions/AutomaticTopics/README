Sabrina (Pei-Yun) Hsueh came up with an automatic topic segmenter. Her
output format and the transform should be in CVS at:
 Tools/Transforms/ICSI_Topics

There are two subdirectories as she ran the segmenter at two levels of
granularity: high-level, and sub-topic level. We have given these the
same element names so they can be swapped in but not ever used at the
same time (if you want to use at the same time, ask
jonathan@inf.ed.ac.uk to change the transform or write one yourself
and change the metadata).

This is the metadata fragment for Top Level automatic topics.

    <coding-file name="autotopic" path="../Contributions/AutomaticTopics/TopLevel">
