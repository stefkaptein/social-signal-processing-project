Instructions for ICSI Meeting Summarization

0. Introduction

The AMI project wants to figure out how to summarize meetings
automatically.  In order to do this, we need to annotate the ICSI
Meeting Corpus manually with example summaries.  This corpus consists
of meetings of different work groups at ICSI, a research institution
much like the HCRC.

1. why

When summarizing, it's important to keep in mind the purpose for which
the summary is being constructed.  In this case, we want the summaries
to be aimed at someone who is interested in the research being carried
out at ICSI, for instance, someone who does similar research, but who
works somewhere else.  Such a person might wish to see summaries of
the meetings in order to understand what work is happening at ICSI so
that they can relate it to other work in the field.  For them, the
important questions are: What is the group working on? What decisions
do the group make?  What progress are they making in their work, and
what have they achieved?  What specific problems have they
encountered?

2. what

We will be annotating two different kinds of summaries for this data,
both aimed at the external researcher.  One is *abstractive*,
which involves writing free text that summarizes the meeting, divided
under headings that relate to the purpose for which the summary is
constructed. The other is *extractive*, which is to identify extracts
from the original data which together jointly convey the correct kind
of information about the meeting to fit the required purpose. One can
see them as indexes into the meeting video --- appending them
together might give a sense of what happened, although it's likely to
be very incoherently sequenced, and one might use them to navigate
around the original recording. In addition, we want to establish some 
links between the abstract and the extract.

2.1 abstractive summarization

For abstractive summarization, we have constructed a plain text
template containing a set of headings; to summarize, simply type
free text under each of the headings, making sure to leave the
heading lines alone.  The heading lines begin with [ and end with .
Please ensure that no other lines in the file contain square
brackets, as we will be processing these files automatically.
Also please ensure that you save them in plain text, and just use
ordinary ASCII characters without formatting, even though you are
free to edit them in any way you choose (e.g., emacs or Word).
The categories for free text are as follows:

[ABSTRACT]
    This should just give a general sense of anything that happens
    in the meeting that you think would be a useful summary for the
    target user:  generally speaking, why are they meeting and
    what do they talk about?
[DECISIONS]
    In most of the meetings, the group will make some decisions
    w.r.t. the problems they discuss.
[PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS]
    In a group research meeting, they will introduce what they have done,
    i.e., progress or achievements so far.
[PROBLEMS]
    In some meetings, there may be some open problems,
    or problems they come up with.

Please write a maximum of 200 words for each heading.
We expect the abstract heading to have text in it for all the meetings.
However, the other headings may not require any text at all.
For instance, there may well be meetings that make no decisions.
In these cases, please do not leave it blank, but fill it with ``*NA*''.
Even in the best cases, these headings may require rather *less than
200 words* to describe.

You might find it helpful to have a view of the hierarchical structure
of the meeting. Fortunately, we have done some topic segmentation
in this way. What's more, there is topic description for each segment.
You can load the meeting into the topic segmentation tool and view
it that way while writing the abstractive summary. But remember:
*although the free text summary should convey some information
from the topic segmentation, we wouldn't expect that to look like a
list of topics ("First they discussed this and then they discussed that")* 
because we can derive that from the topic segmentation itself --- 
we are looking for something more selective and preferably more
coherent than that.

2.2 extractive summarization

We have written a special-purpose annotation tool for extractive
summarization.  It shows one utterance or dialogue act (i.e., a
stretch of speech that expresses one speaker intention) per line,
with a speaker ID at the beginning (please note, the unit of
utterance here is different from that for topic segmentation). To
include an utterance in the summary, select it by left-clicking on
it, and then right-click (noted as L-R-click). Another L-R-click
removes it from the summary.  Remember that all the extracted 
dialogue acts together should convey what the group is working on, 
decisions, progress, achievements, and problems, in order to fit 
the summary's purpose.

2.3 extract-abstract linking

It's very obvious that the extractive summary should
support what's noted down in the abstractive summary. In order
to show this we need to link the extracted utterances with some
sentences in the abstractive summary. So after you finish extraction, 
you should go through the extracted utterances one by one, 
L-R-click its supported sentence(s) in the abstractive summary to make
a link between the extracted utterance and abstractive sentence(s).
A second L-R-click will remove the link. Sometimes it's possible 
that you can not find any closely related abstractive sentence 
for the extracted utterance. Do not bother if this happens. 

3. How

When you summarize a meeting, say, Bmr005 (i.e., <observation>), 
follow the steps below

0) preparation
0.1) if you are new to AMI-related annnotation, you will need to apply 
for AMI cvs access (filling in the online application form at 
http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/systems/cvs/new/). After receiving a confirmation,
you can setup cvs as follows:

0.1.1) first create a directory for ami cvs, say ~/ami/cvs (highly recommended).
then set the environment variable by add the next line to your ~/.benv
 _export CVSROOT=:pserver:<cvs-username>@cvs.inf.ed.ac.uk:/disk/cvs/ami_
and run *source ~/.benv* to effect it without relogin.

0.1.2) change to your local ami cvs directory and do cvs initialization
   *cd ~/ami/cvs* (or somewhere alike),
   *cvs -d <absolute path for local ami cvs> init*
   *cvs login*

0.1.3) checkout the data
   *cvs co Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Main*
   *cvs co Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/TopicSegmentation*
   *cvs co Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/Summarization*
   *ln -s /group/project/ami1/ICSI/audiomix Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Signals*

0.2) if you are new to ami-summarization (including new to ami-related annotation),

- change to the top directory of your AMI checkout of the 'Data', i.e., 
   *cd ~/ami/cvs* (or somewhere alike),
- log in to CVS server
   *cvs login*
- check out the latest tools
   *cvs co Tools/NXTtools*
- copy scripts from there to current directory
   *cp Tools/NXTtools/startsumm ./*
   *cp Tools/NXTtools/extractive ./*
   *cp Tools/NXTtools/checkinsumm ./*
   *cp Tools/NXTtools/topic.sh ./*
- run the script for the first time to finally get you prepared
   *perl startsumm -u <cvs-username>* 

1) for abstractive summarization, give the text file the name
*Bmr005.abssumm.txt* and put it under your subdirectory, i.e.
    Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/Summarization/abstractive/<cvs-username>

To view the segmentation, you need to make sure if there is a section for topic
in the interaction-codings part (that is, within the
<interaction-codings> tag) of the metadata file  
(Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Main/ICSI-metadata.xml). 
If no, please add the following to there

            <!-- topic codings from the NXT topic Segmenter -->
            <coding-file name="topic">
                <structural-layer name="topic-layer" recursive-points-to="segment-layer">
                    <code name="topic">
                        <attribute name="type" value-type="string"/>
                        <attribute name="description" value-type="string"/>
                    </code>
                </structural-layer>
            </coding-file>


then copy Bmr005* from Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Contributions/TopicSegmentation/sashby
to Data/ICSI/NXT-format/Main, and start the segmentor with *sh topic.sh* and 
select Bmr005.

2) for extractive summarization, start the tool with 
   *perl extractive -u <cvs-username> -o <observation>*. 
Then L-R-click to select or deselect an utterance.
NB: finish and save abstract FIRST and BEFORE starting the tool.

3) After you finish extraction, go through the extracted utterances one by 
one, judge if any sentence in the abstract is supported by the extracted 
utterance. Then L-R-click on the abstractive sentence to make a link. 
As usual, another L-R-click removes an existing link.

4) After you finish summarizing a meeting, in order to check it into the CVS 
repository, you will need to run the checkin script
    *perl checkinsumm -u <cvs-username> -o <observation>*

Please pay attention to the message from the checkin.
If you suspect there is anything wrong with your checkin, 
please contact the coordinator ASAP.

Please quit the tool completely before opening another meeting,
partly because this will free up memory on your machine,
so the tool will run faster.
