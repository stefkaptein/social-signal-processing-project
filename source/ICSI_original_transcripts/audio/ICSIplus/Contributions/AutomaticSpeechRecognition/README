=====================================================
AUTOMATIC TRANSCRIPTS OF THE  COMPLETE ICSI CORPUS (BEST GUESS ASR OUTPUT)
Added to the repository 11/2/05
==================================================

The AMI ASR group [1] has generated this set of automatic word level
transcriptions of the ICSI meeting corpus [2].

0. Conditions of Use

This file can only be used by partners of the AMI project [1],
otherwise special permission needs to be obtained. The transcripts
should not be separated from this README file and researchers using
it should be made aware of the conditions of use.

1. Content

The distribution consists of word level transcriptions of speech
segments as given in the original corpus. The transcripts also include
the dev and eval sets as used in the RT04 NIST meeting
evaluations. Overall, this covers 74.7 hours of speech in 112904
segments.


2. Generation

This set of transcripts was generated by 4-fold cross-validation. The
complete set of transcripts was divided in 4 parts and acoustic and
language models were trained on 3 parts. These models were then used
to run decoding on the 4th part. The system is based on a PLP
front-end, decision tree clustered crossword triphone models and an
interpolated bigram LM.

For exact details of the models please contact Thomas Hain or other
members of the AMI ASR team.

The transcripts were originally stored in the file icsi-trans.v1.mlf using
the standard HTK [3] format:

...
"*/BDB001-C01_mn017_0053267_0053396.lab"
0 500000 <s>
500000 7200000 EXACTLY
7200000 9900000 YEAH
9900000 13000000 </s>
.
....

The first line gives the name of the utterance, which encodes
the name of the meeting, the recording channel, the speaker ID and
start and end time of the segment in 10ms units. The first letter of
speaker ID is the gender of the speaker.

The following lines are the start and end times of words in 100
nanosecond units (standard HTK) and the words themselves. All words
are in uppercase and <s> and </s> denote sentence start and end
respectively.

PLEASE NOTE: The word times include an an arbitrary length
silence at the end of each word.

3.  Data as served by the repository

In this CVS repository, the transcripts are given in NXT format
compatible with the other annotations that exist.  

Use this metadata fragment to load the ASR transcription, adding
these declarations to the <agent-codings> section of the metadata:

            <!-- ASR version of the words -->
            <coding-file name="asr" path="asr">
                <time-aligned-layer name="asr-words-layer">
                    <code name="asrword" text-content="true"/>
                    <code name="asrsil"/>
                </time-aligned-layer>
            </coding-file>

            <!-- ASR segments (sentences) -->
            <coding-file name="aseg" path="asr">
                <structural-layer name="asr-segs-layer" points-to="asr-words-layer">
                    <code name="aseg" text-content="true">
                        <attribute name="participant" value-type="string"/>
                    </code>
                </structural-layer>
            </coding-file>
